## **Project Overview**

I conducted an in-depth analysis of a dataset with over 20,000 sales records from Amazon. Using PostgreSQL, I explored key areas such as customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends. This project allowed me to solve complex SQL challenges, including revenue optimization, customer segmentation, and efficient inventory management, delivering actionable insights to enhance business decision-making.

This project also focuses on data cleaning, handling null values, and solving real-world business problems using structured queries. By ensuring data accuracy and addressing key challenges, I delivered insights that supported strategic decision-making.

An ERD diagram is inclined to visually represent the database schema and relationships between tables to help in clarification of the structure and ensuring efficient data querying and analysis.

## **Database Setup & Design**

### **Schema Structure**

	category_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	category_name VARCHAR(20)
);

);

    order_id INT, -- Foreign key	
    product_id INT, -- Foreign key	
    quantity INT,	
    price_per_unit FLOAT,

## **Task: Data Cleaning**

I cleaned the dataset by:
- **Removing duplicates**: Duplicates in the customer and order tables were identified and removed.
- **Handling missing values**: Null values in critical fields (e.g., customer address, payment status) were either filled with default values or handled using appropriate methods.

---

## **Handling Null Values**

Null values were handled based on their context:
- **Customer addresses**: Missing addresses were assigned default placeholder values.
- **Payment statuses**: Orders with null payment statuses were categorized as “Pending.”
- **Shipping information**: Null return dates were left as is, as not all shipments are returned.

---

## **Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to showcase SQL proficiency through complex queries that address real-world e-commerce business challenges. The analysis covers various aspects of e-commerce operations, including:
- Customer behavior
- Sales trends
- Inventory management
- Payment and shipping analysis
- Forecasting and product performance
  

## **Identifying Business Problems**

Key business problems identified:
1. Low product availability due to inconsistent restocking.
2. High return rates for specific product categories.
3. Significant delays in shipments and inconsistencies in delivery times.
4. High customer acquisition costs with a low customer retention rate.

p_order_id INT,
p_customer_id INT,
p_seller_id INT,
p_order_item_id INT,
p_product_id INT,
p_quantity INT
)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$

DECLARE 
-- all variable
v_count INT;
v_price FLOAT;
v_product VARCHAR(50);

BEGIN
-- Fetching product name and price based p id entered
	SELECT 
		price, product_name
		INTO
		v_price, v_product
	FROM products
	WHERE product_id = p_product_id;
	
-- checking stock and product availability in inventory	
	SELECT 
		COUNT(*) 
		INTO
		v_count
	FROM inventory
	WHERE 
		product_id = p_product_id
		AND 
		stock >= p_quantity;
		
	IF v_count > 0 THEN
	-- add into orders and order_items table
	-- update inventory
		INSERT INTO orders(order_id, order_date, customer_id, seller_id)
		VALUES
		(p_order_id, CURRENT_DATE, p_customer_id, p_seller_id);

		-- adding into order list
		INSERT INTO order_items(order_item_id, order_id, product_id, quantity, price_per_unit, total_sale)
		VALUES

		--updating inventory
		UPDATE inventory
		SET stock = stock - p_quantity
		WHERE product_id = p_product_id;
		
		RAISE NOTICE 'Thank you product: % sale has been added also inventory stock updates',v_product; 
	ELSE
		RAISE NOTICE 'Thank you for for your info the product: % is not available', v_product;
	END IF;
